            Because this product is free software there is limited support. I will however support this
            product as much as I can be giving FREE support via my website. There you can post questions
            or suggestions. I hope a community will form to help eachother out and to share knowledge.<br />
            <br />
            For any other questions, read the documentation in the "/doc" folder of this installation.<br />
            <br />
